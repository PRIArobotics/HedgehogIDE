# Hedgehog IDE

Hedgehog IDE is a web-based programming environment for beginners.
Its main use case is robot programming with the integrated 2D simulator.
Programs are written in JavaScript or with a visual, Blockly-based language.
All user-written code is saved and executed in the browser,
making sure that educators can use the IDE without worrying about their students' privacy.
