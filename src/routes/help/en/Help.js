          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Sensors let the robot observe the simulated environment. Sensor values are between 0 and
            4095, the exact value ranges depend on the type of sensor though.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" component="div" paragraph>
            The simulated robot has eight sensors at its front:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Four line sensors that can detect black lines on the ground; these are sensors 0 to
                3, from left to right. These sensors change color to orange when a line is detected.
                <br />
                <strong>Values:</strong> The sensor value is high when a (dark) line is detected,
                otherwise (on light surfaces) it is low.
              </li>
              <li>
                Three distance sensors looking forward and slightly to the sides can detect
                obstacles without touching them; these are sensors 4 to 6, from left to right. The
                rays coming out of the robot's front indicate the direction and range of these
                sensors.
                <br />
                <strong>Values:</strong> The sensor value increases when getting closer to an
                obstacle, then decreases again when the obstacle almost touches the robot. This
                behavior models a distance sensor very popular in hobby robotics.
              </li>
              <li>
                One bump sensor that is almost as wide as the robot front; this is sensor 8. This
                sensor changes color to orange when a line is detected.
                <br />
                <strong>Values:</strong> The sensor value is low when a collision is detected. This
                behavior models a &quot;pull-up&quot; circuit that is often used for touch sensors.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" component="div" paragraph>
            Sensors come in two varieties, analog and digital:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Analog</strong> sensors can take on many different values; a good example is
                the distance sensor. To use an analog sensor, you have to work with the numeric
                values between 0 and 4095.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Digital</strong> sensors only have two possible states, e.g.
                &quot;collision&quot; and &quot;no collision&quot; or &quot;line&quot; or &quot;no
                line&quot;. For these sensors, you can simplify your work by using digital values:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Analog values 0 bis 2047: Digital value <code>false</code>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Analog values 2048 bis 4095: Digital value <code>true</code>
                  </li>

            the same behavior as the block for reading a digital value, but using the comparison
            block lets you adjust the threshold.

          Create this program in your project, then click the green &quot;Play&quot; button; you
          will see the robot driving to the other side of the simulation and stopping at the wall.
          In detail, what happened is the following:
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="div" paragraph>
          <ul>
            <li>The first block let the robot move forward.</li>
            <li>
              The next block is a loop, running while the sensor on port 8 has a high digital value.
              Sensor 8 is the bump sensor, and high values mean no collison. In other words, the
              loop repeats until a collision is detected.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inside the loop, the program simply sleeps. Even though the program pauses, the motors
              are still moving. That means that the robot will continue moving as long as there was
              no collision.
            </li>
            <li>
              After the loop, i.e. as soon as there was a collision, the robot is stopped. This is
              the last command, so the program is finished.
            </li>
          </ul>
