        The Hedgehog IDE allows you to create and run your own programs easily, without installing
        extra software or creating accounts first. We respect your privacy and your data, so we
        don&apos;t require any of your data unless absolutely needed - that is, basically, the code
        you write and nothing else.

          The Hedgehog IDE is still at the beginning. Things may be rough around the edges, and not
          all features are there yet. Future features, such as sharing code with others, will

        After opening the project, right click the project root to create a file in it. In this
        example, let&apos;s choose &quot;New Blockly File&quot; &ndash; Blockly allows the visual
        creation of programs. After naming the file, make sure it&apos;s shown in the project tree,
        and open it by double-clicking. You will see a Blockly workspace where you can create your
        program.

        Controlling a simulated robot with Blockly
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Before you start adding blocks to your program, let&apos;s look at the simulator. Click on
        the X,Y,Z axis icon above the project tree to open it in a new tab, then drag that tab to
        the side to see Blockly and the simulator at the same time.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" paragraph>
        <Grid container spacing={1}>
          <Grid item sm={12} md={6} className={`${s.gridImg} ${s.gridImgLg}`}>
            <img src={help3img1} alt="moving the simulator" />
          </Grid>
          <Grid item sm={12} md={6} className={`${s.gridImg} ${s.gridImgLg}`}>

      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        The Simulator (and the console, which is opened with the second button above the project
        tree) opens automatically when a program gives commands to the robot (or outputs text,
        respectively) if it is not already open.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Blockly commands are organized by categories:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" paragraph>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Drive</strong> lets you drive the robot by starting or stopping two motors at
            the same time. Motors can use speeds between -1000 and +1000. The simulated robot&apos;s
            left wheel is motor 0, the right wheel motor 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Motors</strong> lets you control motors individually.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Servos</strong> lets you control servos. Servo positions are between 0 and 1000.
            The simulated robot does not yet have any servos, though. Stay tuned!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sensors</strong> lets you observe the simulated environment. Sensor values are
            between 0 and 4095. The simulated robot has five sensors at its front:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Four line sensors that can detect the black lines on the ground; these are sensors 0
                to 3, from left to right. The sensor value is high when a line is detected.
              </li>
              <li>
                One bump sensor that is almost as wide as the robot front; this is sensor 8. The
                sensor value is low when a collision is detected.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The other categories contain general programming constructs, such as conditionals and
            loops.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Now let&apos;s try out a simple program:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" paragraph>
        <Grid container spacing={1}>
          <Grid item xs={12} className={`${s.gridImg} ${s.gridImgLg}`}>
            <img src={help4img1} alt="example program" />
          </Grid>
        </Grid>
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Create this program in your project, then click the green &quot;Play&quot; button; you will
        see the robot driving to the other side of the simulation and stopping at the wall. In
        detail, what happened is the following:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" paragraph>
        <ul>
          <li>The first block let the robot move forward.</li>
          <li>
            The next block is a loop, running while the sensor on digital port 8 has a high value.
            In other words, the loop repeats until a collision is detected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inside the loop, the program simply sleeps. That means that the robot will continue
            moving as long as there was no collision.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the loop, i.e. as soon as there was a collision, the robot is stopped. This is the
            last command, so the program is finished.
          </li>
        </ul>
