# Developer Documentation

This directory contains developer documentation for the Hedgehog IDE.
It covers general information on the architecture, code style recommendations and APIs.

## Project structure

Hedgehog IDE is originally based on [React Starter Kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/) but has departed from its structure in places.

- `HedgehogIDE`
  - `.vscode`:
    VS Code IDE configuration
  - `build`:
    output of the build process
  - `docs`:
    this directory
  - `favicons`:
    favicon package generated by https://realfavicongenerator.net/
  - `flow-typed`:
    [Flow](https://flow.org/) type definitions of external packages
  - `gsl_blockly`:
    [gsl](https://github.com/SillyFreak/gsl/) code generator for the [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) language of the Hedgehog IDE
  - `gsl_sdk`:
    [gsl](https://github.com/SillyFreak/gsl/) code generator for the plugin SDK of the IDE
  - `mongodb`:
    mongodb data directory used when using `yarn mongod`
  - `node_modules`
  - `public`:
    static ressources; mainly favicon variations, but also manifest files
  - `src`
    - `client`:
      browser entry point; setting up React rendering in the browser
    - `components`:
      frontend logic of the Hedgehog IDE; will be expanded upon later
    - `core`:
      shared logic between client and server; mostly data model definitions
    - `executor`:
      an additional browser entry point for the code execution iframes
      - `sdk`: APIs for calling IDE function from an execution iframe
    - `routes`:
      route definitions for [universal-router](https://github.com/kriasoft/universal-router)
    - `sdk`:
      API definitions exposed to the execution iframes
    - `server`:
      backend logic including SSR, GraphQL API and MongoDB persistence
    - `serviceworker`:
      [https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox](Workbox)-based service worker for offline functionality
    - `tools`:
      see also the `tools` directory below: extracted tools for use in the production environment
    - `translations`:
      language files for [react-intl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intl)
  - `template`:
    React Starter Kit documentation files
  - `test`:
    Tests
  - `tools`:
    Build scripts


## Tools

The base for developing the Hedgehog IDE is formed by
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/) 12 or later.
To get started, clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PRIArobotics/HedgehogIDE/
cd HedgehogIDE
yarn install
```

Some code is generated by [gsl](https://github.com/SillyFreak/gsl/);
that code is part of the repository, so gsl is not required for most development,
only when extending generated code;
that is, blocks for visual programming and the plugin SDKs.
gsl requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6 or later and can be installed via `pip`:

```bash
pip install gsl[yaml]
```

Although most features of Hedgehog IDE are browser only,
some features require a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database; we use MondoDB 4.

All tools used for developing or building are provided as yarn/npm commands.
Here are the most common ones:

```bash
# code style & linting
yarn lint                   # runs eslint to check code for potential problems
yarn fix                    # same as above, but applies automatic fixes including code formatting

# build & start web server
yarn start                  # start the server in development mode with hot reloading
yarn build                  # build the server
yarn build --release        # build the server in release mode
yarn serve                  # serve the built server

# code generation
yarn codegen                # generates type definitions for GraphQL queries
yarn codegen:i18n           # generates internationalization message bundles
yarn codegen:i18n --check   # checks translation status
yarn codegen:gsl-blockly    # generates visual programming block definitions
yarn codegen:gsl-sdk        # generates plugin SDK API definitions

# start auxilliary services
yarn mongod                 # start MongoDB server for server-side storage
yarn start-peer             # start PeerJS server for WebRTC peer-to-peer connectivity

# management
yarn create-user            # create user in MongoDB
```

Most features require neither of the two auxilliary services,
and these features will work when they are not running;
however, Hedgehog IDE does *assume* that both MongoDB and WebRTC are available,
so failing to use either will not be communicated gracefully to the user.

## Development

For development, the `yarn start` command enables hot code reloading,
allowing one to leave the server running in the background and seeing most of the changes.
This feature is limited in a few places, though:

- because of how the web server is set up to enable hot reloading,
  GraphQL subscriptions will not work
- server-side changes may only be applied in a limited capacity,
  because old objects may still be referenced;
  e.g., changing Mongoose models will not work
- generally, client-side code changes will be reflected without issues.

To use subscriptions or work around other limitations of the hot reloading infrastructure,
use `yarn build` and `yarn serve`.

## Deployment

`yarn build --release` will build the relevant files for deployment.
The built artifacts look as follows:

- `build`
  - `public`:
    These files are to be served under the URL where Hedgehog IDE operates
    - `assets`:
      Output of the Webpack compilation process
    - `sw.js`, `sw.js.map`:
      The service worker; outside of `assets` because of security restrictions of service workers

    all other files in `build/public/`, such as favicon variations, are copied from `public/`
  - `server`:
    These files are the server-side Hedgehog IDE application
    and should be deployed anywhere outside the web server document root
    - `chunks`:
      Output of the Webpack compilation process
    - `server.js`, `server.js.map`:
      Server entry point
    - `runTool.js`, `runTool.js.map`:
      Management tool entry point for production
    - `package.json`, `yarn.lock`:
      project metadata for dependency installation

The server will also need all node dependencies installed,
so also run `yarn install --production --frozen-lockfile`
in the server destination directory.

In addition to these artifacts, a MongoDB instance and a PeerJS server must be started.
For MongoDB, refer to their documentation; PeerJS is installed as a dependency so to start it, run the `node_modules/.bin/peerjs` binary.

Have a look at `src/server/config.js` to see how to configure
the interaction between the different systems, as well as external ones.
