        The Hedgehog IDE is allows you to create and run your own programs
        easily, without installing extra software or creating accounts first. We
        respect your privacy and your data, so we don&apos;t require any of your
        data unless absolutely needed - that is, basically, the code you write
        and nothing else.

          The Hedgehog IDE is still at the beginning. Things may be rough around
          the edges, and not all features are there yet. Future features, such
          as sharing code with others, will require you to share some more data
          with us. Those features will be strictly optional and opt-in, though.

        A software project contains files that work together to create a
        program. Creating one is the first thing you will have to do to get
        started. In your <Link to="/projects">project list</Link>, click on the
        &quot;+&quot; icon and choose a name. After you created the project,
        click on it to open it.
